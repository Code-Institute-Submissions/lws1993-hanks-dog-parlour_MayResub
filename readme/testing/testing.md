## **Bugs**

Bug | Fix
--------|--------
Products_product does not exist | There where no connections in my PostgreSQL on heroku, so I loaded my categories and products in github again and this solved the issue.
Recieving a 500 error and my css was not laoding | I had to change the debug to 'DEVELOPMENT' in os.environ and export the debug to be True so get the css to laod.
Aws no activated |I had some trouble activating my aws account to access the s3/bucket section but the support team at aws helped me sort this out.
