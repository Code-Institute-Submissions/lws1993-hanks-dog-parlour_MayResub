### **Project Goals**
The primary goal of this project is to create a website that works perfectly, is visually appealing in design, and easy to navigate for a first-time user. It allows users to perform not only the basic functionalities in a website (for example sign up/login, ability to purchase items, and perform payments), but also to ensure that users have a great experience and more interactivity within the site through additional functionalities such as put items into their basket and purchase these items.

### **User Goals**
The user will be looking for:
- A website that is straight forward and intuitive to use, easy to navigate and also make a purchase.
- A website where there is a variety of products that can also be searched individually by the user.

### **Site Owner Goals**
As a site owner, I would like to provide a clear, easy to navigate, eye catching site that users will enjoy visiting and find everything they are looking for. I want to give access to a shop for users to buy items. I would also want the user to gain access to a basket feature which will allow the user to come back to their basket and have the items they have selected ready for when they want to pay. By achieving this, the user will be able to delete and update their basket with no trouble.
