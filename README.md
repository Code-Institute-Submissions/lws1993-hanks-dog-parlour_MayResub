  ## **UX (User Experience)**

  [Back to contents](#content)

### **Target Audience**
- Dog lovers
- All ages

[Back to contents](#content)

### **Project Goals**
The primary goal of this project is to create a website that works perfectly, is visually appealing in design, and easy to navigate for a first-time user. It allows users to perform not only the basic functionalities in a website (for example sign up/login, ability to purchase items, and perform payments), but also to ensure that users have a great experience and more interactivity within the site through additional functionalities such as put items into their basket and purchase these items.

### **User Goals**
The user will be looking for:
- A website that is straight forward and intuitive to use, easy to navigate and also make a purchase.
- A website where there is a variety of products that can also be searched individually by the user.

### **Site Owner Goals**
As a site owner, I would like to provide a clear, easy to navigate, eye catching site that users will enjoy visiting and find everything they are looking for. I want to give access to a shop for users to buy items. I would also want the user to gain access to a basket feature which will allow the user to come back to their basket and have the items they have selected ready for when they want to pay. By achieving this, the user will be able to delete and update their basket with no trouble.

### **User Stories**
As a shopper I want to be able to:

- I want the main purpose of the site to be clear for when new/exisiting customers visiy.
- I would like the site to be easy to navigate so that the content can be founf quickly and with ease.
- I want to view a list of products and items by searching for individual words.
- I would like to view my total purchases at any time and have the option to update and delete items out of my shopping bag.
- I would like to successfully register for an account and proceed to log in.
- I want to be able to store my shipping details so that itâ€™s easier for me to check out.

## **Design Choices**

### **Fonts**

![fonts](ReadMe/media/fonts/font-1.png)
![fonts](ReadMe/media/fonts/font-2.png)
![fonts](ReadMe/media/fonts/font-3.png)
![fonts](ReadMe/media/fonts/font-4.png)
![fonts](ReadMe/media/fonts/font-5.png)
![fonts](ReadMe/media/fonts/font-6.png)

When choosing a font I came across a number of really good fonts to chose from on google font and also dafont just to see if they had anything that google font did not. After a meeting with the client and vigorous testing I decided to go with oswald as this was the most eye catching and was very similar to the original logo that the client had sent me. I also went with san-serif as the backup font just in case my chosen font failed.

### **Colours**

![fonts](ReadMe/media/Color/hanks.png)

The website I used to get my pallet was coolors.com which I uploaded the logo that the client gave me and this generated a pallet for. I chose these colors to have a choice just in case one color collided with another. I only use one three colors from this pallet wich where #000000, #ffffff and #D1A702. 

### **Imagery**

I will create a image for the main home page banner which will feature a random dog parlour. I had to import this image into photoshop to alter a few things so that the image was suitable for my website.

The imagery came straight from the client herself so i never had to search for any images. This made the process of making the website quicker as I never had to look arround for any images to use. The images are located in my static folder. The only image i grabbed from google was a no image sign which was used just incase the user admin did not want a image on there or accidently added a product but forgot the image.

## **Deployment**

Once app was setup and ready to go I deployed to Heroku by following the steps below:

* I created an app on the heroku website which i called ms4-fit-as-a-fiddle

    * I clicked on the new button.
    * I then clicked on the create a new app link.
    * I then gave my app the name of ms4-fit-as-a-fiddle and chose europe as my closest region.
    * Finally, I selected to create my app.

* Next, I set up the postgres database.

    * in Heroku,
        * Go to app resources section, search for postgres
        * then I chose to add to project and chose the free plan for my project.
        * In order to use Postgres, I had to install two dependecies in gitpod, dj_database_url and psycopg2
    
    * in Gitpod
        * I installed both dj_database_url and psycopg2 using the command:
            * `pip install`
        * then, using the command: pip3 freeze > requirements.txt, I added the dependencies to the requirements file which is needed by Heroku.
        * Then in settings.py I imported dj_database_url:
            * `import dj_database_url`
        * then, I commented out the current database settings and replaced it with the settings of the postgres database:
        ```
        DATABASES = {
            'default': dj_database_url.parse('DATABASE_URL')
        }
        ```
        * DATABASE_URL above is an environmental variable and as such should not be shown  in version control. The database url can be found from your app config settings in heroku.
        * Once the above method is set up, models need to be migrated to the new database using the command below:
            * `python3 manage.py migrate`
        * I then created a new superuser for my site on heroku using the command below:
            * `python3 manage.py createsuperuser`
        * When that was done I then commited my changes and made sure not to include environmnet variables in the version control.
        * Then, I created an if-else statement in the settings.py to use Postgres if the DATABASE_URL variable is available and otherwise use the default database in gitpod.
        ```
        if "DATABASE_URL" in os.environ:
                DATABASES = {
                    "default": dj_database_url.parse(os.environ.get('DATABASE_URL'))
                }
          else:
                DATABASES = {
                    'default': {
                        'ENGINE': 'django.db.backends.sqlite3',
                        'NAME': BASE_DIR / 'db.sqlite3',
                    }
                }
        ```
        * The postgres database should now be ready for use.

    * Gunicorn
        * For the app to work on heroku we need a way for heroku to tell that the app is a web application, which is where Gunicorn comes in.
        * Installing Gunicorn
            * `pip3 install Gunicorn`
        * A Procfile then needs to be created to tell heroku how to run our app. this is acheieved below:
            * `touch Procfile`
        * In the Procfile we need to tell it to use a webserver, this is achieved by placing the below code in the procfile:
            * `web: gunicorn <appname>.wsgi:application`
    
    * We now need to connect to Heroku in the terminal on gitpod
        * use the following command
            * `heroku login -i`
        * Login using your email and password that you used to create an account with on heroku website.
        * then, I disabled the collection of static files temporarily until AWS has been set up.
            * `heroku config:set DISABLE_COLLECTSTATIC=1 --app <appname>`
            * the --app command is used when you have more than one app in your heroku account
        * Now, in settings I added heroku into my list of allowed hosts, and localhost so the project can still b run locally using the following settings.
            * `ALLOWED_HOSTS = ["<heroku appname>.herokuapp.com", "localhost"]`
        * changes were then pushed to Github
        * Then I needed to set up pushing to heroku achieved below
            * `heroku git:remote -a <heroku appname>`
        * then the project gets pushed to github using:
            * `git push heroku master`
        * Heroku now builds the app.
    
    * On the Heroku Website
        * Go to the deploy section of the app.
        * I searched for the app being used in github
        * When it was found I connected and then clicked on enable Automatic deploys
        * Now any changes pushed to Github will automatically be pushed to Heroku too.
    
    * Amazon AWS
        * Amazon AWS was used to store both static and media files of my project
        * I created an AWS account and worked through the process of signing-in. Once my account was setup I was able to set my project up on aws.
        * first, I needed to create a bucket.
            * search for aws s3 service.
            * click on the Create Bucket button.
            * Give the bucket a unique name and then select the region.
            * uncheck the block public access and acknowledge that the bucket will now be public.
            * click create bucket.
        * Bucket settings
            * Properties
                * Go to the bucket Properties section
                * Turn on static website hosting
                * in the index and error text inputs, add index.html and error.html.
                * then, click save.
        * Permissions
            * Go to the bucket Permissions section.
            * In the cors config paste in the below code:
                * ```
                    [

              ```
        * Back in heroku click on settings tab and then click reveal config vars.
        * Then set up the environmental variables as required.
        * Back in the IDE, we need to create a custom storages.py to tell django that in production we want to use Amazon S3 to store our static and media files
        * import S3Boto3Storage at the top of the custom_storages.py file.
        * Set up classes to tell django where to store the files as shown below:
            * ```
                class StaticStorage(S3Boto3Storage):
                    location = settings.STATICFILES_LOCATION
                
                class MediaStorage(S3Boto3Storage):
                    location = settings.MEDIAFILES_LOCATION
              ```
        * push all the changes to Github from the IDE
    
    * Add Media files to AWS
        * in your AWS bucket, create a new folder called media
        * select upload and then upload all your image files
        * select to grant public access
        * finally, click to upload your files.
    
    * Setting the project up locally

        * Find your github repo, on the code dropdown.
        * then choose to extract files to your respository.
        * open the IDE of your choice and open the folder contaoining the code using your IDE.
        * Once this is done, you can now download the requirements needed to run the project using the below command in your IDE terminal:
            * ` pip3 install -r requirements.txt `
        * You can also choose to clone your files from github to your repository in the IDE by again, choosing the code dropdown in tour github repo and copying the HTTPS url that is provided in the dropdown.
        * then when the url has been copied return to your terminal and use the code below:
            * ` git clone https://github.com/Brianconn71/fit-as-a-fiddle.git`
        * once this is done, you then need to set up the below environment variables to use full functionality of the site:
            * DJANGO_SECRET_KEY = your secret key
            * STRIPE_PUBLIC_KEY = your stripe public key
            * STRIPE_SECRET_KEY = your stripe secret key
            * STRIPE_WH_SECRET = your stripe webhook secret
            * IN_DEVELOPMENT = True
            * Your stripe variables which can be found on your stripe dashboard
            * You need a Django secret key which can be found [here](https://miniwebtool.com/django-secret-key-generator/)
        * Then you need to migrate the database models to set up your own database.
            * first check for migrations:
                `python3 manage.py makemigrations --dry-run`
            * then make migrations:
                * `python3 manage.py makemigrations`
            * check to see how migrations will work out:
                * `python3 manage.py migrate --plan `
            * lastly, if all looks good, migrate:
                * `python3 manage.py migrate`
        * Now, a superuser account needs to be created to access the admin section, so follow the step below to create a superuser
            * ` python3 manage.py createsuperuser `
        * enter your own username and password
        * finally, we need to run the project to ensure working order and we are good to go.
            * ` python3 manage.py runserver`
